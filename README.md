# YoutubeVideoDownloader
![ALT Text](https://github.com/Hyprr96]/YoutubeVideoDownloader/blob/main/logo.png?raw=true)
A simple Tkinter GUI I created to download Youtube videos. 
Pardon the poor code, and non-existent requirements text file; this was created for a school project during a time when I wasn't as well versed in Python and coder-stuff.
Anyways, this is just a simple video downloader that downloads the highest quality available (capped at 720p, check comments at bottom for why that is) in the path the file 
is in. This is a pretty cool project but Tkinter's outdated graphics and terrible performance is bothering me so I might update this program to utilize PyQt instead of Tkinter in the near future.
